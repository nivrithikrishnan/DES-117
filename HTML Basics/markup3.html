        <h1>A Few Poems by Ogden Nash</h1>
        <h2>The Panther</h2>
        <p> The panther is like a leopard,<br>
            Except it hasn't been peppered.<br>
            Should you behold a panther crouch,<br>
            Prepare to say Ouch.<br>
            Better yet, if called by a panther,<br>
            Don't anther.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Lines on Facing Forty</h2>
        <p> I have a bone to pick with fate,<br>
            Come here and tell me girly,<br>
            Do you think my mind is maturing late,<br>
            Or simply rotting early.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Lama</h2>
        <p> The one-l lama,<br>
            He's a priest.<br>
            The two-l llama,<br>
            He's a beast.<br>
            And I will bet<br>
            A silk pajama<br>
            There isn't any<br>
            Three-l lllama.<br>
        </p>
