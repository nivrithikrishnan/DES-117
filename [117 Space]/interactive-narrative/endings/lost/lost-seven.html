    <h1>You Lost</h1>
    <h2>You begin to walk towards the noise, and find yourself in the kitchen. As you step inside, you see a little girl. You try and ask her if she needs help but she doesnt answer you. You turn to look around to see if anyone else is around, when she grabs a knife from the kitchen counter. She throws it at you. With nothing to defend yourself, you bleed out and die. </h2>
