          <p>In 1965, Wiley discovered, and eventually bought, an odd wooden object resembling a step stool in a Mill Valley thrift store. Wiley and his student, Bruce Nauman, treated it as both a muse from which to take inspiration and a subject in need of a biography. The Slant Steps on view here were made during that first moment of excitement around this mysterious object.</p>

          <p>Early in his career, Wiley created intimate objects that reveal a restless artist. He also rendered in different styles, trying flat graphic representations (Reflections on Egypt, 1964, shown above), delicate graphite feathering (Yang Yen, 1965) and muted surrealism (Modern Art Teacher). Wiley's work in these years is replete with pyramids, the rhinoceros and the enigmatic question mark.</p>
