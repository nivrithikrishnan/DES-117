                    <p>The article covered semantic HTML5, or tags used to indicate specific information. The purpose of these tags are to provide robots/crawlers (ex: Google and Bing) understand the different components of your webpage and signify an element's importance. </p>

                    <p>While I had some knowledge on how to structure a web page, and apply the basic tags (header, footer, etc.), I didnâ€™t quite realize the full impact these tags had prior to reviewing the article. I mostly just incorporated them for my convenience, making the code easier to follow, rather than prioritizing the use of semantic tags. I was also able to gain a better understanding of the difference between specific tags like the article/section and aside which always slightly confused me. </p>
                        
                    <p>The article I styled for the previous assignment did not make use of most of the semantic tags. I tend to fall back on using divs, which do not provide any insight into the role the content within plays. Going forth, I plan to focus on trying to incorporate more semantic tags into both my HTML and my designs. Having a clear header, navigation, and separate sections rather than chucks of loose text. </p>
